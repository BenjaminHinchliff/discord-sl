# Discord SL: Cure your (nonexistant) bad habit of mistyping

## Information
SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across discord when you type "sl" as you meant to type "ls". For all the times you're typing that on discord.

The acsii train is borrowed from the original command at [https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl), but the implmentation on discord is my own.

## Usage
Click [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=711374632699297844&permissions=2048&scope=bot) oauth link to add the bot to your server.

## Disclaimer
Due to discord bot rate limiting I'm limited to animating at roughly 1 fps, so sorry about that (there's not much I can do).

Also, due to the padding, it looks best on a pretty big monitor otherwise text wrapping can happen (which looks pretty bad). I've set the width to 50 columns if that's useful to know.
